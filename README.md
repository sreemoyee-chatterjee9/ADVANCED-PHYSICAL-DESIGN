# ADVANCED-PHYSICAL-DESIGN
Here, all the learnings during the workshop : [ADVANCED PHYSICAL DESIGN USING OPENLANE/SKY130](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/advanced-physical-design-using-openlane-sky130/) is documented with the examples and the experiments. Essentially, this workshop document was made concentrating on the daily activities that has been explored during RTL2GDS end to end flow with the open-source flow: OpenLane. Core design utilized duirng this process is PICORV32A RISC-V.

# Introduction


### Day 1 :: Inception of open-source EDA, OpenLANE and Sky130 PDK
FPGA, an acronym for Field Programmable Gate Array, is an integrated circuit (IC) that is built with a large number of logical processing resources, or logic blocks. These logic blocks consist of digital logic components such as multiplexers, flip-flops, lookup tables, and adders. We can divide the FPGA in three main parts: *
* <pre>Configurable Logic Blocks  — To implement logic functions.</pre>
* <pre>Programmable Interconnects — To implement routing.</pre>
* <pre>Programmable I/O Blocks    — To connect with external components.</pre>

We are focusing on the implementation of the logic functions, which comes within the Processor/SoC.

**Chip Package:**

Packages are empty vessels into which the bare chip is placed. Tiny wires connect the leads on the package with the leads on the chip. Pin Location of the package are driven by ARUDINO Board that we are trying to design. The Chip at the center of the package. All the input signals coming from the outside will be trasferred to the chip via the wire connection. Following is the example of QFN 48 PIN Package \[7mm X 7mm\]:

The Chip sitting inside the package consists of various components.
* <pre>PADS : Through pads, the signals can be sent inside/outside of the chip. They are intermediate structures connecting internal signals from the core of the integrated circuit to the external pins of the chip package.</pre>
* <pre>DIE  : Die is the complete chip which gets manufactured on the silicon wafer. It is the square of silicon containing an integrated circuit that has been cut out of the wafer, on which the given functional circuit is fabricated.</pre>
* <pre>Core : Core is the section of the chip where the fundamental logic of the design is placed.</pre>
