# ADVANCED-PHYSICAL-DESIGN
Here, all the learnings during the workshop : [ADVANCED PHYSICAL DESIGN USING OPENLANE/SKY130](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/advanced-physical-design-using-openlane-sky130/) is documented with the examples and the experiments. Essentially, this workshop document was made concentrating on the daily activities that has been explored during RTL2GDS end to end flow with the open-source flow: OpenLane. Core design utilized duirng this process is PICORV32A RISC-V.

# Introduction


# Day 1 :: Inception of open-source EDA, OpenLANE and Sky130 PDK
FPGA, an acronym for Field Programmable Gate Array, is an integrated circuit (IC) that is built with a large number of logical processing resources, or logic blocks. These logic blocks consist of digital logic components such as multiplexers, flip-flops, lookup tables, and adders. We can divide the FPGA in three main parts: *
* + <pre>Configurable Logic Blocks  — which implement logic functions.</pre>
* + <pre>Programmable Interconnects — which implement routing.</pre>
* + <pre>Programmable I/O Blocks    — which connect with external components.</pre>

We are focusing on the implementation of the logic functions, which comes within the Processor/SoC.
